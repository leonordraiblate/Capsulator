# Methodology 🧮:

1️⃣: **I created a database from scratch on excel** 
  📁 clothes.xlsx
    📊 "Database": I described 130 outfits from 4 different styles (Minimalist, Athleisure, Streetwear, Business casual) creating a table where each row corresponds to a specific outfit and the columns a distinct clothing item. When one of the items were presented on the outfit, I would attribute it a 1 and 0 otherwise. Additonaly, I added a image link for ach item.
    /n
    📊 "Mapping": Also, because I needed to give them categories to help distinct between Tops, Bottoms, Coats and so on, I created a categorization table.  
    📊 "Voting Pictures": Because I needed to present pictures of outfits to the web users to access their preferences, I also described other 26 new outfits following the same logic.
    
    📊 "voting_pictures", "dummy_table" and "image_table": Simplied the original tables to have no images and formatting, to be used on python.
    
2️⃣: **Developed the product based recommendation engine**
